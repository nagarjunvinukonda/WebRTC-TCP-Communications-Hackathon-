#Nimble Programming Challenge

* The challenge is exciting, interesting and there are a lot many things i have learnt. It is send a video stream between server and client using aiortc library of TCPsocketSignalling.


* In given span of time I was able to complete communication between server and client while multiprocessing with queue. Generate 2D image frames of ball bouncing. Create multi-processsing process_a.
  

# Dependencies:
* Linux(18.0.4)
* Python 3.4+
* Numpy
* Opencv
* aiortc
* multiprocessing

# To launch files:
1) Open Terminal with two tabs

2) Run:
python3 server.py

3) In another terminal Run:
python3 client.py


# Further to be done:

* Debug compute_xy of ball to get the center
* Send x,y coordinates back to server from client
* Perform Unit tesing
* implement docker containers
